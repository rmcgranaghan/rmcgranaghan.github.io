                <!-- <h2>About Me</h2> -->
                	<p> Current work: </p>
					<p> I am the Principal Data Scientist and Aerospace Engineering Scientist at Orion Space Solutions in Boulder, CO (though I lead the Washington DC branch), where I coordinate data science and machine learning efforts to improve our understanding of the Earth’s space environment. I also work extensively across NASA Centers, including Goddard Space Flight Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 2013, I received the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, in recognition of profound vision for the future of Earth and Space Science research. I was also awarded the illustrious NASA Jack Eddy Fellowship designed to train the next generation of space physics researchers. Most recently, I was selected by the prestigious NASA Heliophysics Early Career Investigator Program, which provides support for the most promising young scientists conducting Heliophysics research. </p>
						
		    			<p> My first post-Ph.D. work experience was a Visiting Professor position at Dartmouth College in the Fall of 2016. While in Hanover, NH I crafted and taught a course called 'Data Assimilation Techniques' and enjoyed fantastic collaborative research within the Thayer School of Engineering, Applied Mathematics, and Physics Departments. Additionally, I coordinated the Fall Plasma Physics Seminar Series and invited speakers from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, UCLA, MIT, and Boston University. This allowed me to create strong connections between communities, something that I believe is extraordinarily important and powerful. 
						
					<p> In January of 2016 I joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a Jack Eddy Postdoctoral Fellow. My research focuses on the application of data assimilation, complex systems analyses, and data science (e.g., machine learning) to space science research. I am specifically focused on the strongly coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system and the incredibly important space weather effects that result from perturbations to this system due to solar activity.  </p>

					<p> Education:  </p>
					<p> I received my Bachelor's of Science from the University of Tennessee in Aerospace Engineering in 2011. I then joined the Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department at the University of Colorado in Boulder, where I received a Master's of Sciences in 2013 and a Ph.D. in May 2016. Throughout graduate school I was fortunate to have a wide variety of professional experiences, including with NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Marshall Space Flight Center, Los Alamos National Laboratories, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Space Weather Prediction Center, and Aerospace Concepts Pty. Ltd.  </p>

						<p> Personal:  </p>
						<p> But before I am a researcher I am many things. I’m also a Father, Husband to a Mother, Brother, Son, Companion. <p>
						
						<p> My personal time is spent reading, listening to and discovering new music, enjoying the great outdoors in any way possible, and following my favorite sports teams (Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates). In 2015 I was selected to give a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOVHUo_qbgc" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferrer"> TEDx</a> talk that gave me a deep passion for public speaking and the importance of communication and data visualization.  </p>
						<p> I'm an adventurous and active person always looking for new experiences. A few of my favorite things are good beers, coffees, and conversation. Oh, and, of course, enjoying time with my wife Rachel, learning alongside my daughter Stella, and exploring the world with my blue tick hound, Tupelo!</p>
