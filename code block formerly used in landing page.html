								<p>Heliophysics is the study of the very nature of our active star and its effect on space. This effect has profound impact on our use of space, both through human presence and technology, colloquially known as space weather. However, Heliophysics also addresses a broader picture - the solar-terrestrial system provides a natural astrophysical laboratory through which to understand the entire universe.
									I have passionately worked in the field of Heliophysics for the past decade, discovering new knowledge through a blend of aerospace engineering, space physics, and data science. </p>

								<p>Scientific pursuit is mired in data - big, complex, and challenging data. The digital age has transformed the generation, storage, and transfer of knowledge and we face a critical time in science to envision, design, and deliver data technologies that ease the challenges of knowledge sharing. 
									I use tools and technologies from the budding field of data science to make science and engineering data more accessible and usable.</p>
